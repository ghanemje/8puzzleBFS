8-puzzle Solver using Breadth-First Search

Run the code in MATLAB
Upon clicking ‘Run’, the program will prompt the user to enter that initial matrix in the form of 
[1 2 3;4 5 6;7 8 0]
An example is also show in the prompt.


The code will run and all the needed information will be stored in the text files Nodes, nodePath, and NodesInfo automatically in its file directory. The code will run for a maximum of 9! times (maximum solutions for a 3x3 matrix) and will explore all possible solutions for the matrix. If no solution is found, the code will return “No Solution Exists”.
If a solution exists, the code will return the number of iterations it took, number of nodes, the node path as MATLAB command output, and all the needed 3 text files.
Detailed and thorough comments are provided throughout the code.
